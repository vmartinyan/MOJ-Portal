== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the Visual Composer page builder.
2. Unzip the downloaded addons-for-visual-composer.zip file and upload to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install the Visual Composer Addons by Livemesh plugin from WordPress repository. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. For Portfolio element, install and activate the <strong>optional plugin</strong> <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-post-type/" title="Portfolio Post Type">Portfolio Post Type plugin</a>. The Portfolio addon can be built using custom post type registered by this plugin.

Optionally, you can import the sample data that replicates the demo site for you by importing the file sample-data.xml file located in the plugin directory. The import option is available under Tools &gt; Import in WordPress admin. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with the theme that I am using? =

Our tests indicate that the addons work well with most themes that are well coded. You may need some minor custom CSS with themes that hijack the styling for heading tags by using !important keyword.

Some themes override default templates provided by Visual Composer. The themes that override VC Row template may require you to manually set the attributes required for the dark version (see below).

The demo site is best recreated with a theme that supports a full width page template without sidebars. The elements can still be used in the pages of default template.

= How to enable the dark version for any element? =

In Visual Composer page builder, add a row wrapper for the element, edit row and check the option 'Dark Background?' at the end of General tab of the row or an inner row element.

For themes that override the VC row template with one of their own, you may need to add a custom class 'lvca-dark-bg' manually to the VC row wrapper element to activate the dark version of an element.

= My portfolio does not show any items. =

Pls install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/portfolio-post-type/" title="Portfolio Post Type">Portfolio Post Type plugin</a> to enable custom post type Portfolio.
